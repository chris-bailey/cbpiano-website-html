# HTML / CSS version of Chris Bailey Piano website
The initial version of [Chris Bailey Piano](chrisbaileypiano.com), my new age piano website, utilizing simple HTML & CSS.

It was subsequently ported to Vue.js and the code is available on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/chris-bailey/cbpiano-website-vue).

It was then finally ported to Nuxt.js and that code is available on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/chris-bailey/cbpiano-website-nuxt).
